## üöÄ Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Potential Additions
- [ ] Custom reward creation (manager can define team-specific rewards)
- [ ] Reward images/badges instead of emojis
- [ ] Email notifications when rewards are unlocked
- [ ] Reward categories/collections (e.g., "Striker Collection")
- [ ] Seasonal reward reset functionality
- [ ] Export rewards to PDF/image for sharing
- [ ] Reward rarity levels (common/rare/legendary)
- [ ] Comparative rewards ("Most Improved Player")

### Analytics Ideas

---

## üìù Notes

- **Performance**: Reward evaluation runs after match completion only (not real-time)
- **Duplicates**: UNIQUE constraint prevents same reward from being awarded twice for same match
- **Season tracking**: Uses `team.season` field to group season-based rewards
- **Extensibility**: Metadata JSONB field allows for future complex criteria without schema changes

---

## ‚úÖ Production Ready
- All components tested and working
- No TypeScript errors
- RLS policies in place
- API routes secured
- Privacy controls implemented

**Status**: üü¢ Ready for Production Use
