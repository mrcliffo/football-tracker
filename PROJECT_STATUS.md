## Known Issues and Considerations

### Resolved Issues
- âœ… RLS infinite recursion (fixed in migration 009)
- âœ… Missing shadcn components (alert-dialog, textarea, radio-group, tabs)
- âœ… Match awards table schema (simplified to player_of_match only)

### Current Limitations
- No performance trend visualizations (future enhancement)
- No export functionality for statistics (future enhancement)
- No multi-season comparison (future enhancement)
- No email invitation system for parents (future enhancement)
- No privacy settings UI for managers (future enhancement)

### Performance Considerations
- Database view (`player_stats_view`) auto-updates with match events
- Client-side caching in stats components reduces API calls
- RLS policies optimized to avoid circular dependencies
- Efficient queries using PostgreSQL aggregation
